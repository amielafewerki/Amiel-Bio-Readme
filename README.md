# Amiel-Bio-Readme
Hello, my name is Amiel. I am a rising senior at Woodrow Wilson High School in Long Beach, California. I have always been a tech geek ever since I was 5. I figured out ways to work through problems related to any of my family's digital devices. You can name it, whether it's something small, like a phone, or something big, like a computer or television. I believe that this is the result of my traits, like being a quick learner as well as my resilience, because if there was a problem, I wouldnâ€™t stop trying until it was fixed. This relates to coding because, as hard as it may be, I still love overcoming a challenge and having a good result for a coding task. My goals are to further develop my coding/programming skills with the KKCF Fellowship. I also hope to major in Artificial Intelligence or IT Development.
