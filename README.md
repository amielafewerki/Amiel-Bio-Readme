# Amiel-Bio-Readme
Hello, my name is Amiel. I am a rising senior at Woodrow Wilson HighSchool in Long Beach, California. I've always had an interest in coding. I have always been a tech geek ever since I was 5. I figured out ways to work through problems related to any of my family's digital devices. You can name it; whether it was something small like a phone to something big like a computer or television. I believe that this is the result of my traits like being a quick learner as well as my resilience because if there was a problem, I wouldnâ€™t stop trying until it was fixed. This relates to coding because as hard as it may get, I still love overcoming a challenge and having a good result for a coding task
